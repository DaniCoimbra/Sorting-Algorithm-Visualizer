# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
The Sorting Visualizer project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive and visual way to understand various sorting algorithms. The project utilizes a container that displays a set of bars representing elements of an array to be sorted. Each bar's height represents its value. Users can customize the size of the array, the sorting algorithm, the speed of the visualization and randomize the array. The available sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, and Bucket Sort.
